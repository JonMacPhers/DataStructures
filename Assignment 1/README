Program Description
**************************
 This program runs and compiles the LinkedListAPI.C file. It comes with a self 
 test Testfile.c to check and validate the functions of the Linked List. 
 the LinkedList file comes with many functions for creating and organizing list structures of
 many different data types
 
 Several functions need to be implimented by the user for them to work appropriately 
 since the data type going into the linked list is arbitrary, and these functions must be type-cast
 with the right type of data to work correctly. 


************
Compilation
************
 To compile this code:
 run: make

 To compile the testing program:
 run: make test

  Detailed Make options:

  make  runs the cppcheck option
  make prog needs to be altered with your own program file name if you want to use the linked list module
  make test compiles the Testfile.c program with the library
  make doxy creates the doxygen documentation in the docs subdirectory
  make clean removes executable files

****************************
Known Limitations, Issues and Errors
****************************

 the function used by the delteItem function pointer in linked-List doesn't do anything. Either build errors or
 cppcheck errors exist when trying to clear contents of the node, or it auto clears duplicate entities (!?). 
 
 double-deleting lists causes one's computer to explode. 
 
 has not been tested with any other data types besides INT.
